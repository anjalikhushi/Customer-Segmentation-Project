# Customers-Segmentation-Kmeans
  Introduction: Provide an overview of the project and the objective of the analysis. Explain why customer segmentation is important for businesses and how it can be used to improve marketing strategies and customer satisfaction.

  Data Description: Describe the customer segmentation dataset and the features included in it. Explain why each feature is relevant for customer segmentation and how it was collected.

  Exploratory Data Analysis: Present the results of the exploratory data analysis conducted on the dataset. This could include descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analyses of the different features.

  Customer Segmentation: Describe the clustering algorithms used to segment customers based on their demographic and spending behavior. Explain the criteria used to determine the number of clusters and the performance of the clustering models.

  Results and Interpretation: Present the results of the customer segmentation analysis, including the number and characteristics of the different customer segments. Interpret the findings and provide insights into how businesses can use this information to improve their marketing strategies and customer experience.
# About Data:
 CustomerID: This is a unique identifier for each customer in the dataset.
 
 Gender: This indicates the gender of the customer, with 'Male' or 'Female' as the possible values.
 
 Age: This indicates the age of the customer in years.
 
 Annual Income (k$): This indicates the annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
 
 Spending Score (1-100): This is a score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior, with 1 being the lowest score and 100 being the highest score. This score is typically 
 calculated based on factors such as the customer's spending habits, frequency of purchases, and total amount spent.
 
Together, these features can be used to analyze and segment customers based on their demographic and spending behavior. For example, we could use clustering algorithms to group customers based on similar age, income, and spending patterns, which could then be used to develop targeted marketing strategies or product recommendations.


# Steps:
1) Import the data into a data analysis tool such as Python or R.
2) Check the data types and missing values.
3) Use descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation to understand the central tendencies and spread of the different variables.
4) Visualize the distribution of the variables using histograms or box plots.
5) Analyze the correlation between different variables using a correlation matrix or scatter plot.
6) Finding the optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method.
7) Use clustering algorithms such as k-means to segment customers based on their demographic and spending behavior.
8) Visualize the results of the clustering analysis using a scatter plot or heat map.
9) Draw conclusions and insights from the analysis, and present them in a report format.
